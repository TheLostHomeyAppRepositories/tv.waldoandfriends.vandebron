The Vandebron app for Homey provides insight into the 'Greenest Moment' of the day, allowing you to make the most of sustainable energy. By using this information, you can operate household appliances at times when green energy is most available. This way, you make conscious choices and contribute to more sustainable energy consumption.

Disclaimer: this app does not provide insight into your energy consumption, as there is often more than a day's delay in this data via the Vandebron API.
